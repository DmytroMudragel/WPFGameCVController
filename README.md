# Computer vision controller for full automation in an MMORPG game

The controller was designed as a cross-platform solution using .NET C# and XAML in WPF .NET, and additionally, a messenger bot was developed to fully automate the gaming process.

The unique color-coding technique was developed for transferring data through images; the Dijkstra algorithm was employed for navigating in the graph path structure; OCR is used to recognize enemies and text in the game. 

The controller's primary goal is to use computer vision to navigate the game character through the game world, ride a mount, search for enemies, kill them, collect loot from them, restock ammunition at vendors, and run from the spawn point after they are killed. In addition to that, it can close, update, and reopen a game instance upon its update, rewhisper messages to the game chat.

## Features:

The controller can operate on a remote system with a physical graphics adapter, and all available operations can be commanded from the messenger bot assistant.
